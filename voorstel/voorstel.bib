  abstract     = {Purpose Gamification is a tool with great potential to motivate individuals to increase their physical activity. That is why sport apps for mobile devices, such as Nike+ or Strava, have integrated game elements. There is, however, little evidence of gamification's effectiveness in this field. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of game elements included in gamified sports' apps on the satisfaction of basic psychological needs (i.e. competence, autonomy and relatedness). Similarly, the research analyzes the impact of these needs on autonomous motivation. Design/methodology/approach To achieve these goals, data were collected from users of gamified sport apps, using an online questionnaire. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings The results showed that interaction in the app with achievement-related game elements satisfied the needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness; social-related elements satisfied the need for relatedness; and immersion-related elements satisfied the needs for competence and autonomy. Similarly, satisfaction of the needs for autonomy and relatedness while using the app is crucial to experience autonomous motivation. Practical implications The findings of this study provide guidelines for practitioners and app developers. Originality/value Based on self-determination theory, the paper provides new insights into the relationship between game elements included in sport apps and individuals' basic psychological needs and motivation. 目的 遊戲化在推動人們增加其體力活動方面是有極大潛能的。因此，設於流動通訊設施的運動應用程式如耐克(Nike)及Strava等都結合了遊戲的元素。唯遊戲化在這領域的功效方面的證明並不多。因此，本研究的目的，在於分析遊戲化運動應用程式內的遊戲元素，對滿足基本心理需要的影響 (即是說，能力水平、自主及關聯性)。同樣地，本研究分析這些需要對自主積極性的影響。 研究設計/方法/理念 要達到這些目標，數據以一項網上問卷調查方法取自遊戲化運動應用程式的使用者。數據並以偏最小二乘結構方程模型進行分析。 研究結果 研究結果顯示、在帶有成就相關的遊戲元素的應用程式內的互動滿足了能力水平、自主和關聯性的需要; 與社交有關的元素滿足了關聯性的需要，而與沉浸相關的元素則滿足了能力水平和自主的需要。同樣地，使用應用程式時，要能體驗自主動機、關鍵在於自主及相關性的需要得到滿足。 實務方面的含意 本研究結果為執業者及應用程式開發商提供了指引。 研究的原創性／價值 以自決理論為基礎，本研究為運動應用程式包含的遊戲元素與個人的基本心理需要和動機之間的關係提供新的見解。},
